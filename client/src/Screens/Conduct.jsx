      <h1 className="mb-4">Code of Conduct</h1>
      <h5>
        When you join Developer Student Club MAIT, you’re joining a community.
        And like all growing communities, a couple of ground rules about
        expected behavior are good for everybody. These guidelines cover both
        online (e.g. mailing lists, telegram group, virtual meetings) and
        offline (e.g. in-person meetups) behavior. This code of conduct applies
        to all members of this community and all new members are informed to
        make sure they have read it.
      </h5>

      <h4 className="mt-4">1. Core Values</h4>
      <p>
        &bull; Commitment - We are required to undertake our best to commit to
        the course of the community but fully participating in our activities.
        Join in on discussions, show up for in-person/virtual meetings
        regularly. <br />
        &bull; Collaboration - Work together! We can learn tons from one
        another. Share knowledge, and help one another out.
        <br /> &bull; Respect - We are all required to respect everyone who is
        part of this community and every other person invited to be a part of
        the community during our activities. Remember to be respectful and
        constructive together with your communication to fellow members within
        the telegram group. don't get into flame wars, make personal attacks,
        vent, or rant unconstructively. Everyone should take responsibility for
        the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a
        negative discussion as early as possible. Property belonging to people
        like laptops, phones, and bags must be respected.
        <br />
        &bull; Honesty and Integrity - We expect this to be observed altogether
        dimensions. In addressing others, performing tasks, and handling
        responsibilities during every event conducted by DSC MAIT <br />
        Etiquette for virtual discussions - Don’t send messages to an enormous
        list that only has to head to one person. Keep off-topic conversations
        to a minimum. Don’t be spammy by advertising or promoting brands that
        are completely unrelated to the cause of the DSC MAIT Community.
        <br /> &bull; Step down considerately - If you've got some kind of
        responsibility in your community, bear in mind your own constraints. If
        you recognize that a new internship or personal situation will limit
        your time, find someone who can take over for you and transfer the
        relevant information (contacts, passwords, etc.) to the DSC Lead for a
        smooth transition.
      </p>

      <h4 className="mt-4">2. Decision-making</h4>
      <p>
        We are a community and thus any decision made affects the entire
        community. Let it be made clear that anyone within the community can
        give suggestions for decisions and can only be applicable if approved by
        the DSC Lead and core team of the community. It'll be against the code
        of conduct for a decision affecting the entire community to be made and
        implemented without consulting the DSC Lead.

        harassment, trolling or bullying shall not be tolerated and may result
        in one losing their DSC MAIT membership. <br />

        member of DSC MAIT won't be tolerated.
